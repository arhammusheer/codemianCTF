# Welcome to CodemianCTF

This is a copy of all challenges run in the codemianCTF with all their flags.

It includes challenges related to cryptography, forensics and web.

## Cryptography
This section will teach you about cryptographic ciphers and encryption algorithms, for example caeser ciphers, RSA low exponent vulnurabilities and more.

#### Tools you may need
- crypii.com
- Cipher identifier websites
- python is your best friend
- knowhow about RSA

## Forensics
This section will teach you about how to extract data from files hidden in different formats starting from incorrect file extensions upto pcap files extracting files from PCAP sniffs and decrypting them.

#### Tools you may need
- File extension identifier
- Wireshark
- RSA decryptor using RSA private key

## Web
This section will teach you about web technologies and vulnurabilities using cookies, JWT token security etc.

- Curl/REST client
- Knowledge on JWT tokens
- You could always just inspect element but don't be obsessed with it. It ain't much help everywhere.

Have fun...
